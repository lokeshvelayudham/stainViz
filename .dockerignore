model/
# We ignore model/ because we will mount it as a volume or copy specifically if needed.
# Since models are large, better not to copy them into the image build context every time if possible.
# But for simplicity, if user wants a self-contained image, they should be copied.
# However, for development, mounting is better. I will ignore them for context speed.
